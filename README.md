This repository contains the R code used in the essay "The impact of economic and demographic conditions on COVID-19 diagnosis delays and deaths in Hong Kong".

By runing the codes in this repository, you can get the same figures and models of them.

There are 2 .R documents in this repository, which describes the demographic of Covid-19 patients in Hong Kong with different groups and the survival analysis respectively (Essay Code_Demograph.R and Essay Code_Survival Anlysis.R).

In Essay Code_Demograph.R, it is divided into 4 different parts: The demographic of district/territory, the correlation matrix in Covid-19 patients, the case fatality rate (CFR) among reporting delay & hospitalization time, and time series plot of Covid-19 cases & death. To generate the picture you required, you  need to run all the packages/codes mentioned in the top 19 lines of code. Then,use Ctrl + F and type the following sentences to find your target figure:

For the demographic of district/territory: #District & Territory Demographic
For the CFR among reporting delay & hospitalization time: #CFR among reporting delay & hospitalization time
For the correlation matrix in Covid-19 patients: #Correlation
For the time series plot of Covid-19 cases & death: #Time-Series Plot

Finally, you can run the corresponding codes to generate the figures.

In Essay Code_Survival Anlysis.R, it is divided into 2 parts: K-M curves and Cox regression model.To generate the picture & models you required, you  need to run all the packages/codes mentioned in the top 27 lines of code. Then,use Ctrl + F and type the following sentences to find your target figure/model:

For the K-M curves of all Covid-19 patients: ##aplan-Meier (K-M) non-parametric analysis of all Covid-19 patients##
For the K-M curves of symptomatic Covid-19 patients: ##Kaplan-Meier (K-M) non-parametric analysis of Symptomatic Patients##
For the Cox regression model: #Cox proportional hazard model & Assumption#

Finally, you can run the corresponding codes to generate the figures and models.
